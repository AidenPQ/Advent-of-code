## Repository layout

```text
Advent-of-code/
├─ 2024/            # solutions for 2024 (one file/folder per day)
├─ Inputs/2024/     # personal input files (see policy note below)
├─ .gitignore
└─ README.md
```

## How to read this repo

- **2024/** contains my daily solutions (Part 1 & Part 2).
- **Inputs/2024/** is where I keep **my** personal inputs locally.  
  These inputs are unique per user and **shouldn’t be shared** publicly (per AoC rules).

If you want to try a solution, use the **sample input** from the puzzle statement on adventofcode.com and place it where your script expects it (or pipe it via STDIN).
